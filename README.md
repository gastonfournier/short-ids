# Short ids
A simple example to show how we can shorten the length of an UUID by changing it's representation

If you run the ShortUuids class you'll get an output like this:

```
f4543acf-68a0-4b23-a7de-8a3587199c76 length: 36
f4543acf68a04b23a7de8a3587199c76 length: 32
11110100010101000011101011001111011010001010000001001011001000111010011111011110100010100011010110000111000110011001110001110110 length: 128

```

and here you can find an analysis based on the range of representable values

There's also this blog post that inspired me to do this: http://www.singular.co.nz/2007/12/shortguid-a-shorter-and-url-friendly-guid-in-c-sharp/

This is my blogpost about it: http://www.gastonfournier.com.ar/post/ids/shortening-uuids/
